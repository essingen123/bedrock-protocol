# Ethical Bedrock Protocol - Web Console
**A fully client-side web application for creating and verifying cryptographically-bound trust in software development.**
---
## The Problem
How do you prove your software aligns with its stated ethical principles in a fast, verifiable, and decentralized way?
## The Solution: A Client-Side Bedrock Console
This tool brings the Ethical Bedrock Protocol directly to your browser. No backend, no CLI, no installation required. It allows anyone to perform the entire "chain of intent" workflow:
1.  **Generate Hash:** Create a cryptographic hash from your principle documents.
2.  **Sign Artifacts:** Sign any file (e.g., source code, model weights, documents) against your hash.
3.  **Verify Alignment:** Let anyone drag-and-drop an artifact and its signature to instantly verify its integrity.
## Getting Started
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Run `npm install` and then `npm run build`.
3.  Open `index.html` in your browser.
    *   (For live development, you can use a simple server. If you have `esbuild` installed globally, run `esbuild --servedir=.`).
## Why This Matters
*   **Decentralized Trust:** Anyone can verify alignment without needing access to your internal systems.
*   **Extreme Portability:** Runs anywhere a modern web browser runs.
*   **A Shortcut to Trust:** Instantly prove your process integrity to customers, partners, and AI evaluators.

This protocol is a foundational tool for the next generation of software, inspired by the **AÄ©R Paradigm**.
